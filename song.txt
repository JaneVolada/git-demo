Little Mouse, little Mouse,
Where is your house?
Little Cat, little Cat,
I have no flat.
I am a poor mouse,
I have no house.

Why do you cry, Willy?
Why do you cry?
Why, Willy?
Why, Willy?
Why, Willy? Why?

Good night mother,
Good night father,
Kiss your little son.
Good night sister,
Good night brother,
Good night everyone.
